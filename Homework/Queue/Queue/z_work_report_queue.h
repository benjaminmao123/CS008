    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: push(), pop(), front(), empty(), size(),
            Iterator
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs    : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        This assignment taught me that you can nest classes
        within another class and also showed me how important
        iterators are as it makes your containers generic
        to iterate through.
